# E-Commerce Sales Analysis using SQL

## 📘 Overview

This project builds a mini relational database system to mimic a real-world e-commerce environment. It includes:
- **Database schema design** with 4 interlinked tables: Customers, Products, Orders, and Order_Items.
- **Realistic sample data** covering multiple regions, product categories, and transaction amounts.
- **10 analytical SQL queries** to derive business insights.

## 🛠️ Tables Created
- `customers`: Stores customer details and regions.
- `products`: Contains product names and categories.
- `orders`: Tracks customer purchases and total order values.
- `order_items`: Detailed breakdown of each product in an order.

## 📊 Sample Queries & Insights

1. **Monthly Sales Summary** – Total revenue generated each month.
2. **Top 5 Best-Selling Products** – Based on quantity sold.
3. **Region-wise Revenue** – Sum of sales from each customer region.
4. **Average Order Value** – Mean of all order amounts.
5. **Top Customers** – Customers who spent over ₹5000.
6. **Products Never Sold** – Useful for inventory review.
7. **Most Active Month** – Month with highest number of orders.
8. **Category-wise Sales Summary** – Total quantity sold per category.
9. **High-Value Item Orders** – Orders with items priced above ₹1000.
10. **Customer Purchase Frequency** – Total orders per customer.

## ✅ How to Use

1. Run the schema creation and insert statements in your SQL environment.
2. Use the provided queries to generate insights.
3. Extend with your own queries or dashboards.

## 📂 Ideal For

- Learning and practicing SQL JOINs, GROUP BY, and aggregations.
- Data analysis and reporting use cases.
- Small project portfolio for job applications.

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- Add timestamp granularity (e.g., order_time).
- Create views and stored procedures for complex reports.
- Export insights into visual dashboards using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
